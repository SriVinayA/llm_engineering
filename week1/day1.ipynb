Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

      "4) Projects (strengths)\n",
      "GenAI-Powered Career Companion\n",
      "- Great project to showcase GenAI, microservices, and cloud deployment.\n",
      "- Ensure consistency in tech naming and avoid overloading bullets; provide concrete outcomes if possible.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestions to strengthen:\n",
      "- Add a measurable outcome if you have one (e.g., “reduced resume tailoring time by X%” or “cut interview prep time in half for users”).\n",
      "- Clarify architecture succinctly: “microservices with Next.js frontend and FastAPI backend; containerized via Docker; deployed on AWS (RDS, Cognito, S3).”\n",
      "- Mention security/compliance considerations if relevant (e.g., user data handling, authentication with Cognito).\n",
      "\n",
      "Automated AWS Infrastructure & Data Stream Testing\n",
      "- Solid project showing IaC and data streaming testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggestions:\n",
      "- Make the impact explicit: “validated end-to-end data integrity for Kinesis stream with 99.9% accuracy under load.”\n",
      "- Improve readability by splitting into two bullets rather than a long paragraph.\n",
      "\n",
      "5) Skills\n",
      "- Current list is comprehensive, but formatting can be tightened for readability and ATS.\n",
      "- Group into clean categories and keep consistent terminology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Suggested structure:\n",
      "- Languages: Java, Python, Go, JavaScript, SQL\n",
      "- Backend/Microservices: Spring Boot, Flask, FastAPI, RESTful APIs, Microservices\n",
      "- Databases: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB\n",
      "- Cloud & DevOps: AWS (EC2, S3, RDS, VPC, Kinesis), GCP, Azure, Terraform, Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, Git, CI/CD, Python Boto3\n",
      "- AI/ML: Generative AI, LLMs (OpenAI GPT-4), NLP\n",
      "- Testing: Selenium WebDriver, JUnit, TestNG, Mockito\n",
      "- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, TDD\n",
      "\n",
      "Tips:\n",
      "- Remove redundancy (e.g., “CI/CD” appears in multiple bullets; keep in skills once).\n",
      "- Avoid overly long lines; keep bullets 1–2 lines each in this section.\n",
      "\n",
      "6) Education\n",
      "- Current formatting is a bit confusing and inconsistent.\n",
      "- Clarify degrees, institutions, locations, and graduation dates clearly.\n",
      "- If you’re still in school or have an expected date, mark as “Expected May 2025” or “May 2025.”\n",
      "- Include relevant coursework or projects if space allows (especially courses related to software design, distributed systems, AI).\n",
      "- Suggested clean formatting:\n",
      "\n",
      "Education\n",
      "- San Jose State University, San Jose, CA\n",
      "  Master of Science in Computer Software Engineering\n",
      "  Expected May 2025\n",
      "- Sathyabama Institute of Science and Technology, Chennai, India\n",
      "  [Degree, e.g., B.Tech in Computer Science] — May 2020\n",
      "\n",
      "Notes:\n",
      "- If the second institution is a prior degree, list it with degree name and year. If it’s a different country/college, keep the formatting consistent.\n",
      "\n",
      "7) Formatting, readability, and ATS considerations\n",
      "- Consistency: standardize punctuation, capitalization, and hyphenation. Replace fancy ligatures with standard characters (e.g., “eﬃciency” -> “efficiency”).\n",
      "- Length: with 3–4 roles and multiple projects, aim for 1–2 pages depending on space. If your experience is 5–7+ years, 2 pages is reasonable. If 3–4 roles and projects, 1 page may suffice after trimming.\n",
      "- Bullets: keep bullets concise (1–2 lines each). Long bullets can be split into two bullets for readability.\n",
      "- Active voice: you largely do this, but ensure every bullet starts with a strong verb.\n",
      "- Consistency in tense: past tense for past roles; present tense only for current role (if any) or remove to maintain consistency.\n",
      "- Quantification credibility: ensure numbers are plausible and well-explained. If any number feels large, provide context (e.g., “under load of X TPS,” “peak 10k req/min during load test,” etc.).\n",
